# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

This repository includes my implementations of various machine learning and related algorithms in Python.  

1. innerproduct.py => Includes a vectorized implementation of inner product
2. l2distance.py => Finds euclidian distance between rows of two matrices in a vectorized manner
3. knnclassifier.py => Includes a vectorized implementation of k nearest neighbour algorithm
4. analyze.py => Analyzes the percentage of disrepancies between predictions and real labels. You can use different loss functions as well.
