# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

This repository includes my implementations of various machine learning and related algorithms in Python.  

**Warning**: This repository is a work in progress. Right now, I do not have the time but I plan to add more in the future.

1. innerproduct.py => Includes a vectorized implementation of inner product
2. l2distance.py => Finds euclidian distance between rows of two matrices in a vectorized manner
3. knnclassifier.py => Includes a vectorized implementation of k nearest neighbour algorithm
4. analyze.py => Analyzes the percentage of disrepancies between predictions and real labels. You can use different loss functions as well.
5. BayesClassifier.ipynb => This is for Learning From Data course at ITU. It includes Naive Bayes classifier, data visualization, cross validation etc.
